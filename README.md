# -movies-recommender-project
I create   movies recommender project using python and Machine Learning and test the data using streamlit  and deploy the app.
• Input: A simple movie recommender system for beginners can take as input the list of movies that the user has watched in the past, along with their ratings. This information can be obtained through a user interface where the user enters the movie names and ratings.
• Data Processing: The system can process the input data by creating a matrix of user-movie ratings and using it to generate recommendations. A common method for generating recommendations is to use the cosine similarity between movies, based on the ratings of users who have watched both movies. 
• Recommendation Generation: Based on the processed data, the system generates recommendations by finding the movies that are most similar to the movies the user has rated highly in the past. 
• These recommendations can be presented to the user as a list of movie titles, along with their ratings. The system can also incorporate a limit on the number of recommendations, for example, the top 5 or 10 movies.
